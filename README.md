<h3> Project Description </h3>

<p>

Sangeet AR is a unique app that uses augmented reality to let users explore the realm of classical musical instruments from India. Something really cool happens when the user uses an AR card especially built for this app. In order to do that, just point your Andriod smartphone at a particular card, and suddenly, musical instruments appear right in front of you on the screen!

Users can also interact with these instruments too. There are three of them in the app: tabla, harmonium, and the Indian flute called “bansuri”. When the user taps on them, they make musical sounds, just like the real ones.

To build Sangeet AR, I started from scratch, as I have no little to no experience building a Unity app, but before learning Unity, I did a little background study as I’m already familiar with classical Indian musical instruments like the **Tabla**, which is a set of two hand-played drums. **Harmonium**, on the other hand, is a keyboard instrument that’s often used to accompany classical vocal performances and lastly, the **Bansuri**, the Indian bamboo flute that has a soothing yet melodious tone that is often used in classical music and meditation practices. This study helped me ensure that each instrument in the app was not just a visual representation but also an authentic and faithful reflection of the actual instruments.

Then I started learning the basics of **Unity** & **Vuforia** and how simple things like “_importing your 3D models with textures_” work with Unity and some basic image tracking with the Vuforia engine. After that, I learned how simple fade animation works (“Used in the project to guide users to Show the AR card and Tap to play”).

After learning these skills, I applied them incrementally to my project, and this is how I made the core of Sangeet AR. But there was still something lacking in the app: an onboarding screen or, you can say, a get started screen which will introduce the user to Sangeet AR for the first time.

To make that “First Impression | Get Started Screen”, I used Figma to make several iterations of the **UI** and also made a gradient **logo** with a mandala artwork (“_Representing different variations/emotions associated with classical Indian music_”).

So, that's all for Sangeet AR, a fun and educational app that brings the magic of classical Indian music instruments to your smartphone through augmented reality. Enjoy exploring and playing with tabla, harmonium, and bansuri!
